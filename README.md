## Introduction
This project aims to identify the most valued skills in data science. We used R for data collection, transformation, and analysis, and utilized various R packages and the Google Custom Search Engine API for web scraping.

## Repository Files

- `Project 3.rmd`: This is the main project file containing all the code and documentation.
- `links_to_sites.csv`: This file contains the URLs of top websites found from the webscraping result.

## Summary

We focused on identifying the most valued skills in data science by scraping data from multiple websites. The skills were then categorized and analyzed to understand their frequency and importance in the data science industry. The project offers insights into the most and least frequent skills, along with their significance.

## Future Directions

Future work could involve leveraging advanced machine learning models for more efficient and accurate data extraction and categorization, as well as diversifying the data sources to include more standardized and reliable platforms.
